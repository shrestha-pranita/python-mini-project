1. Dice Rolling Simulator

The Goal: Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates 
rolling dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. 
(Or whatever other integer you prefer — the number of sides on the die is up to you.) 
The program will print what that number is. It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again. 
For this project, you’ll need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. 
For the average die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. 
You’ll also want a function that randomly grabs a number within that range and prints it.

Concepts to keep in mind:

    Random
    Integer
    Print
    While Loops

2. Guess the Number

The Goal: Similar to the first project, this project also uses the random module in Python. 
The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to 
guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) 
If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how 
wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive 
indication should appear. You’ll need functions to check if the user input is an actual 
number, to see the difference between the inputted number and the randomly generated 
numbers, and to then compare the numbers.

Concepts to keep in mind:

    Random function
    Variables
    Integers
    Input/Output
    Print
    While loops
    If/Else statements
